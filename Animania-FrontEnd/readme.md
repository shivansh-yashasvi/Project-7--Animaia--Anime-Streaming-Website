## Tech

Animania uses a number of techs to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - The framework that powers animad's frontend
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

## Running Locally

- Navigate to the root of the project and run `npm install`.
- Similarly navigate to the client folder `./client` and run `npm install` again.
- From the root of the project run `node app.js` and from the client folder run `npm start`.

```
npm install
npm start
```
